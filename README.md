## Overview & Learning Goals
For our mod 1 group project, we will build an application that allows the user to set goals for their health and productivity by creating, using, and logging timers for various set activities.

We will develop our skills and understanding in semantic HTML, clean and organized CSS styles, DRY and organized JS, DOM manipulation, event bubbling/delegation, and persisting data over refreshes using local storage.

Our estimated deadline is as follows:
- **5/26-27/2020** Construct semantic HTML & organized CSS that incorporates smooth, responsive design. Set up Activity class with properties and methods. Team collab style: divide / conquer.
- **5/27-28/2020** Construct form functionality using DOM manipulation and JS interactivity.
- **5/29/30/2020** Construct timer functionality with alert and displayed timer.
- **5/31-6/1/2020** Log and display past activities in sidebar.
- **6/2/2020** If there is time, add local storage functionality to project. If not, spend the time refactoring and making sure all teammates comprehend the code.
